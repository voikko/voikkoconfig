Installation instructions for Voikkoconfig
==========================================

Linux:

- Install the development headers and tools for
  Qt 4.2 (or newer). On Debian this would mean packages
  libqt4-dev and qt4-dev-tools.

- Install Voikko version 1.2, especially the development headers
  for libvoikko.

- Go to directory src and run the following commands
  $ qmake-qt4    (or qmake if you do not have qt3 tools installed)
  $ make
  $ lrelease voikkoconfig.pro  (this will build the Finnish UI translation)

- Run the program:
  $ ./voikkoconfig
