For maintainers and packagers
=============================

The program sources, icons, translations and compilation
control files are located in the subdirectory src/. User
documentation is placed under doc/. The documentation will
be compiled into the produced executable file, so installing
it separately is not necessary.

This program is not designed to use GNU autotools for configuration,
compilation and installation. Currently the build system relies
entirely on the qmake tool shipped as a part of the Qt development
toolkit. If a more comprehensive build system is needed later,
cmake is likely to be the best choice as it has better support for
Windows.

The header files under src/ contain Java style documentation comments
explaining the role and usage of each class, method and class member
variable. The coding style used in the C++ source follows mostly
the conventions used by Java programmers. The comments are used in
the cpp files to only explain the details of some algorithms. All other
comments are in the header files.
